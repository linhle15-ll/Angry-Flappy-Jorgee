AngryFlappyBird.java: Handles game logic, UI setup, animations, collision detection, and difficulty level implementation.

Defines.java: Contains constants for game elements, initializes images, handles sound effects, and scene settings.

Candy.java, Pipe.java, Dragon.java, Floor.java, Goose.java: Represent different game components, including Jorge (the goose), obstacles, and special objects.

## Features
### Basic features
[x] **Bird**: the Goose avoids all obstacles (including pipes, floors and dragons) while
collecting as many eggs as possible. A player uses the button to control the birdâ€™s flight.
There is a wing flap animation when the bird is flying

[x] **Pipe**: appears in pairs every fixed amount of time. One life is taken from the bird when a collision with any pipe occurs. The bird bounces backward and drops immediately upon
collision.

[x] **Candies**: appear randomly on the upward facing pipes and could be collected either by the Dragon or the Goose. If a Dragon collects a candy, points were lost. If the Goose collects a Candy, different events will be triggered depending on the color of the egg. If a **Normal candy** is collected, points will be added. If a **Rainbow Candy** is collected, 6 seconds of autopilot mode will be triggered.

[x] **Dragon**: drops randomly from downward facing pipes and could collect the egg right beneath it and lead to points lost if the egg is not collected by the Goose first. The game is over and score is reset to 0 if the Goose collides with a Dragon. The Goose bounces backward and drops immediately upon collision.

[x] **Floor**: the floor scrolls through the scene consistently during the game until a collision happens. The game is over and score is reset to 0 if the bird collides with the floor. The bird stops moving immediately upon collision.

[x] **Background**: changes from night to day periodically.

[x] **UI panel**: 
- **Start game**: a button that controls the start of the game and the wing flap of the bird, 
- **Level selector**: a comboBox for user to choose the difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Introduction box**: icons with respective text description of the normal candy, rainbow candy and the dragon.

[x] **Scores and Lives**: are updated throughout the game.


### Extra features
[x] **Autopilot mode**: the Goose avoids obstacles during the 6 second snooze period.

[x] **Sound effects** for various events including getting through pipes, collecting eggs, and hitting an obstacle.
